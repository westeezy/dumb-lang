# How do you make a programming lanaguage?

Lets write some javascript to make a worse language

```
  add = function(x, y) { x + y };
  # comment on its own line..
  add(2,2) # this should be 4
```

# Parts

1. Parser
2. Interpreter
3. CPS - ðŸ¤·
4. Compiling to JS???

<h1> <span class="tracking-widest">a l i g n</span> on language first </h1>

- no statements, only expressions. as rich hickey intended ðŸ™ŒðŸ™Œ
- semicolons mandatory cause thats how you end an expression
- sequences in `{}`
- i dont wanna code `return` keyword so last statement wins
- means you can do like:

```js
  a = {
    add(2,1);
    add(9,1);
  };

println(a); # prints 10

# good thing i didnt do fib or something cause math
```

---

# Reading source in ðŸ“–

1. read it all in char by char
2. make some tokens
3. parse it
4. express yourself in code

---

# tips and tricks before

- regex is costly at parse tho kinda handy during lexing
- dont guess intent, just fail with error
- its just hard to write these cleanly for a real language honestly

---

# chomp chomp

get to the chomper

```js
export class Reader {
  /*
   * we basically do this malarky for the position info to be easy to get
   */
  input: string;
  position: number;
  line: number;
  column: number;

  constructor(input: string); // was it dumb to use classes? absolutely

  cursor(): string; // get the current char

  next(): string; // chomp some characters yum

  peek(): string; // look at next char, dont eat

  eof(): boolean; // is this it?

  throw(message: string): void; // whoops cant read that thing
}

```

---

# tokenizer / lexer

what is it?

- similar interface our chomper but instead of outputting chars you output tokens

```js
// add(2,2);
{ type: 'identifier', value: 'add' }
{ type: 'punctuation', value: '(' }
{ type: 'number', value: 2 }
{ type: 'punctuation', value: ',' }
{ type: 'number', value: 2 }
{ type: 'punctuation', value: ')' }
{ type: 'punctuation', value: ';' }
```

ðŸª™ðŸª™ðŸª™ðŸª™ðŸª™ðŸª™

---

# tokenizer rules

1. skip whitespace
2. if you see a `#` its a comment so just treat the rest of line as whitespace
3. if its a quote we got a string
4. if its a digit a number, be careful for decimals
5. if its a letter its prolly a identifier or keyword
6. punctuation is funny in this context isnt it?
7. operators are operators...
8. if its none of these im just gonna throw an error

---

# deep diving into tokenizer idea ðŸ’¡

- `readNext` is our dispatcher which basically just fetches token after token
- `readNext` is on demand (think generators here but in this case i was lazy and didnt use one)

---

# detour to our AST

```js {*}{maxHeight:'400px'}
/*
 a = 5
 b = a *2
*/

{
  "type": "prog",
  "prog": [
    {
      "type": "assign",
      "operator": "=",
      "left": { "type": "identifier", "value": "a" },
      "right": { "type": "number", "value": 5 }
    },
    {
      "type": "assign",
      "operator": "=",
      "left": { "type": "identifier", "value": "b" },
      "right": {
        "type": "binary",
        "operator": "*",
        "left": { "type": "identifier", "value": "a" },
        "right": { "type": "number", "value": 2 }
      }
    }
  ]
}

```

# parser!
from tokens to ast

- these are the trickest parts imo this is a simple [recursive descent parser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_descent_parser)
- aka each step does one piece of the puzzle and just string em together. kinda like making a DSL
- wrote a helped `delimited` to get function args more easily. good place to look
- thank you semicolons for telling me when to stop parsing an expression ðŸ’˜

```js
delimited(start, stop, separator, parser) {
  const resultTokens = [];
  let first = true;
  this.skipPunctuation(start);
  while (!this.input.eof()) {
    if (this.isPunctuation(stop)) break;
    if (first) first = false;
    else this.skipPunctuation(separator);
    if (this.isPunctuation(stop)) break;
    resultTokens.push(parser.call(this));
  }
  this.skipPunctuation(stop);
  return resultTokens;
}
```

---

# parser! CONT
from tokens to ast

- maybe functions are nice to check to see if an expression is a thing or not

```
  maybeCall(expr) {
    expr = expr.call(this);
    return this.isPunctuation("(") ? this.parseCall(expr) : expr;
  }
```

---

# interpreter
i cut a lot of corners by this point

- walk the ast
- executing expressions as you walk
- !!! maintain the environmnet structure (where variables and execution context lives)
- i really skimped on environment. sorry not sorry

---

# continuations!
i didnt do these at all

- right now recursion is limited by js stack
- the language is slow too
- think about how callbacks in node allow you to pass operations which can be `continued` instead of blocking

```js
evalute( expression, environment, callback ) // this is the "signature" for it usually

// looks a lot like 
fs.readFile("file.txt", "utf8", function CC(error, data){
  // look a continuation
  // instead of returning a value it just invokes our callback
});
```

---

# compiling to JS
this was my end goal also didnt get to it

```js
// example of maybe something
function makeAJSFunction(exp) {
    let code = "(function ";
    if (exp.name) {
        code += makeAJSVariable(exp.name);
    }
    code += "(" + exp.vars.map(makeAJSVariable).join(", ") + ") {";
    code += "return " + js(exp.body) `+ " })";
    return code;
}
```

# optimizer

if i skipped the last two sections do you really think i wrote the optimizer?

- no
